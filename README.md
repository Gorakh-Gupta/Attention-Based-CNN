# Attention-Based-CNN
Identification of consolidated and Normal chest.
* In this research, an intelligent system for detecting lungs
consolidation has been developed by utilizing efficient net and
AttentionNet.

* Our dataset contains two classes namely Consolidation and Normal
which in total contains 2043 images. Consolidation class has 1016
images. Normal class has total 1027 images. The result showed that
the overall accuracy of test data obtained was 49% with efficient
net and it increased to 65% when we applied attention layer to the
existing model.
